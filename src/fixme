Move stop/avoid mask creation to specific source/target set, and store them in the probtracks subdir under TRACKMASKS or something instead of injecting the FS6 etc into the filename

Make generic mask with all sources and targets
  Add subcortical, brainstem, opposite hemisphere white matter to get hemi-specific avoid masks
  Subtract target to get target avoid mask
  Subtract all targets to get multi avoid mask

Add all targets to each other to get multi stop/waypoint mask
